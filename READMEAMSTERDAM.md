# About this repository

This repository is a fork from the [sidewalk-cv-2021](https://github.com/michaelduan8/sidewalk-cv-2021)repo. In this fork, I added my own experiments. To start using this repo, follow the guide in the README of this repo and the guide from [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1N4uyNYZS9r0F5Uht_QYrbUqwXejvFkgpgqRUwCXJKWM/edit#). 

There are a couple of things to keep in mind however:

- I had a lot of issues trying to run these experiments on a windows machine. Try using a linux environment instead.
- I have asked Mikey Saugstad for a SFTP key, but this feature is still a work in progress. The panoramas have to be downloaded from a different [repository]( https://github.com/ProjectSidewalk/sidewalk-panorama-tools).
